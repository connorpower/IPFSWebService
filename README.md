# IPFSWebService

The API for communication between a native macOS app and a local IPFS server.
Clients need only include the autogenerated API framework as a Swift
Package Manager dependency.

## Development

This pod uses [Semantical Versioning](http://semver.org) as outlined below:

- **1.x.x**: Major versions. Represents breaking changes in the API.
- **1.1.x**: Minor versions. Represents non breaking API changes (such as new
or expanded features).
- **1.1.1**: Minor enhancements/bug fixes. Represents a non-breaking changes
which do not alter the existing API.

## Dependencies

- Alamofire
- RxSwift

## Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift`
compiler. It is in early development, but IPFSWebService does support its
use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding IPFSWebService as a dependency
is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

#### Swift 4

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/connorpower/IPFSWebService.git", from: "3.0.0")
]
```
